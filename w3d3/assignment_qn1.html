            This is Hailemariam, I am an MSD studnet at Maharishi International University.I am originally from Ethiopia.<br>
            Since I left my country I used to live in Washington Seattle. I tried to register here for Compro masters program<br>
            around February, 2017 . However due to some family issues I went back to my home country as an emergency so  <br>
            that I counldn't do it on that time. But when I get a chance on last Augest I did every requirement on the deadline <br>
            and now I am here.

            When I was in Ethiopia, I studied Civil Engineering for five years and also I started studying Structural Engineering<br>
            in Masters program even if I only studied the Masters program only for one semister because I left my country for the <br>
            UsA. I used to drive as my full time job after I come to the USA since I feel freedom doing an independent contract job.<br>
            I tried to study something great which will help me to succeed and help other people around me. I found out that computer<br>
            science is the most growing field and has much abundant opportunities so that I decided to study Software Development <br>
            program. Since I started studying the program I liked it and I hope I will be much intersted for the future.
